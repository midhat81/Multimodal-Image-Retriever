# Multimodal-Image-Retriever
Multimodal retrieval using text embedding and CLIP image embedding for both visual and text queries! Examples include querying "What do Steller's Jays eat?" or recognizing Blue Jays, returning accurate text details and images. Using CLIP, I bridged text and visuals for improved retrieval across different modalities! #AI #ML #NLP #CLIP
